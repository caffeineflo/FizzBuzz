## FizzBuzz

The initial FizzBuzz game is taken with permission from [@ynzc's](https://twitter.com/ynzc) excellent [Unit-/UITesting Tutorial](https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b#.kvooofxld). FizzBuzz is a great example for a project that implements testing so it'll further benefit from having Continuous Integration execute those tests.
